	x = 10; //initialization the variable. We give value to the variable
		//or can be written in one line as (int x = 10)

	//Expression - anything that can be evaluated (to 1 value). x/2 is an expression which can be evaluated to 5
	
	int y = x / 2; //We declare and initialize the variable

	//question - why not put directly (y = 10 /2), no need x
	//when you are using variable x multiple times, we dont want to have to repeat over and over. Data x can change over time
